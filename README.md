# Week 6

In week 6, I want to make sure which sensor I want to use it, and test it. Finally I make a decision to use the sound sensor and a HC-SR501. But at the first time, I never think about the HC-SR501, I use the distance sensor. But the distance sensor cannot test the coming things is a people, only test the something coming, so I want to change the sensor. Than I use the PIR ，it was a good sensor but there has a red light always bright, it was not I want. Finally, I decided to use a HC-SR501, it was a good sensor to test coming things is people and without any light.

Then I design a workflow to help me to understand the work, to help me to thinking more logically. And I also draw a Tinkecad to help me understand the route map，but the Tinkecad without the sound sensor, so I only can draw the sound sensor and to link it.

# Week 7

In this week I want to link sensors, and test the connect witrh the every sensor. At first, I try to link the LED strip and the sound sensor. But I meet a problem that I did not know how to control the color of the lights, they only show the colorful light and I cannot use the code to control it. So I found the other LED strip, and I found it the code only can use for the LED_TYPE WS2812, and the LED Strip type is different to use it, it can use it under the water. Than I borrow the other LED strip and add the other code about how to control turn off the LED strip.
