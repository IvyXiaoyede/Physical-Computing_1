**Week 6**

In week 6, I want to make sure which sensor I want to use it, and test it. Finally I make a decision to use the sound sensor and a HC-SR501. But at the first time, I never think about the HC-SR501, I use the distance sensor. But the distance sensor cannot test the coming things is a people, only test the something coming, so I want to change the sensor. Than I use the PIR ï¼Œit was a good sensor but there has a red light always bright, it was not I want. Finally, I decided to use a HC-SR501, it was a good sensor to test coming things is people and without any light.
